## Image Naming Convention

- Products: `product-[id].jpg` (e.g., `product-1.jpg`)
- Recipes: `recipe-[slug].jpg` (e.g., `recipe-garlic-chili-noodles.jpg`)
- Hero: `hero-main.jpg`
- Categories: `category-[name].jpg` (e.g., `category-original.jpg`)

For now, placeholder SVG images are generated automatically. Replace these with actual product photos.
